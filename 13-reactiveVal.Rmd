# 13: Why reactivity?

For Shiny apps to be maximally useful, we need reactive expressions and
outputs to update if and only if their inputs change. We want outputs to stay
in sync with inputs, while ensuring that we never do more work than necessary.
To see why reactivity is so helpful here, weâ€™ll take a stab a solving a simple
problem without reactivity.



```{r}
reactiveConsole(TRUE)

out <- reactive({
  message("Computing")
  rv() * 100
})

rv <- reactiveVal(10)
rv()

out()
out()
out()

rv(9)
out()
rv(9)
out()
out()
```
